# .NET Core Template

This repository is a template for .NET Core console application projects. For some reason, I can never remember how to set myself up whenever I have to dive back into C# so this will be helpful to me (and hopefully others) in the future.

Based on the [Hello World](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/learn/dotnet/hello-world-tutorial/create) tutorial from Microsoft's documentation.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Open a terminal and navigate to `./HelloWorld`
3. Execute the application with `dotnet run`
