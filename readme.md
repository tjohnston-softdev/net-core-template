# .NET Core Template

This repository is a template for .NET Core console application projects. For some reason, I can never remember how to set myself up whenever I have to dive back into C# so this will be helpful to me (and hopefully others) in the future.

Based on the [Hello World](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/learn/dotnet/hello-world-tutorial/create) and [NUnit](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/testing/unit-testing-with-nunit) tutorials from Microsoft's documentation.

I have also wrote a list of [steps](./steps.md) on how to do this yourself, summarizing both tutorials.

## Usage

* To run the .NET Core script, navigate to `./HelloWorld` and execute `dotnet run`
* To run the unit tests, navigate to the project root and execute `dotnet test`

## Disclaimer

This demo project is licensed under CC0 1.0 Universal. This is just a personal template for .NET Core console applications that I have made available for public reference. This template was created by following the [Hello World](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/learn/dotnet/hello-world-tutorial/create) and [NUnit](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/testing/unit-testing-with-nunit) tutorials from Microsoft's documentation. The generated .NET Core files are exactly as-is. The generated NUnit test file has been slightly modified so that it is easier to understand.
